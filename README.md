# bash-scripts
Tiny script loader and a bunch of helper scripts

This is a small collection of helper scripts I use on my laptop.
They're pretty specific use cases but some could potentially have some uses.

To use them, just put all the loader into ~/.scripts then add the following to your `.bashrc`:
```bash
source ~/.scripts/LoadScripts.sh
LoadScripts
```

(There's probably a better way but they're tiny and too hacky for some proper method)
